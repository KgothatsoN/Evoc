# Hosting
* Heroku is used to deploy and manage the server-side services of the application.
* Netlify is used to deploy the client-side of Evoc.

# Challenges
Evoc was built with the aid of [JavaScript Mastery](https://www.completepathtojavascriptmastery.com/), a programming course site dedicated to providing comprehensive guides in JavaScript for both beginners and experts. As this was my first JavaScript project, I used the tutorial as a base for building my knowledge. If a piece of technology was used I would then go off and research before returning to the course.
