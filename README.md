Evoc is a Full Stack MERN social media applicaiton, meant for sharing and recalling events around the world. Evoc allows users to Create, Read, Update, Delete, Edit and Admire posts on the site.

# Technologies 

### MERN Full Stack
* MongoDB - Evoc uses MongoDb as it's database solution. Data stored includes but is not limited to Creator, Title and Post Images.
* Express(.js) - Evoc uses Node.js Web Framework to process GET and POST requests.
* React(.js) - Evoc's interface was built using React's client-side JavaScript framework.
* Node(.js) -  JavaScript Web Server

# Challenges
Evoc was built with the aid of [JavaScript Mastery](https://www.completepathtojavascriptmastery.com/), a programming course site dedicated to providing comprehensive guides in JavaScript for both beginners and experts. As this was my first JavaScript project, I used the tutorial as a base for building my knowledge. If a piece of technology was used I would then go off and research before returning to the course.
